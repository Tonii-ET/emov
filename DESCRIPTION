Title: Eye movement analysis package for fixation and saccade detection
Author: Simon Schwab <schwab@puk.unibe.ch>

Depends: R (>= 1.8.0)
Description: An R package for fixation and saccade detection in eye movement recordings. Eye movements consist of alternating saccades and fixations. This package implements a dispersion-based algorithm (I-DT) proposed by Salvucci & Goldberg (2000) and detects fixations in the first place, compared to the velocity threshold algorithms which detect saccades.
